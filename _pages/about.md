I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student at [CEMA](http://cema.cufe.edu.cn/index.htm), [CUFE](http://www.cufe.edu.cn/), majoring in Math, Economics, and Finance. During the summer of 2023, I had the incredible opportunity to attend a session at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), where I delved into courses on Money and Banking, as well as Introduction to Art and Technique of Filmmaking.

Actually, I took inspiration from an academic template to create what was intended to be an academic and professional website. However, I've decided not to approach this endeavor too formally. Instead, I want to share my personal experiences, motivations, and lifelong goals. This narrative may touch upon moments of my secret sorrows and my battles with self-doubt, but it represents the authentic me. 

If you're interested in delving into my story, let's embark on this journey together.
