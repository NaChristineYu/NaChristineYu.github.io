I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student at [CEMA](http://cema.cufe.edu.cn/index.htm), [CUFE](http://www.cufe.edu.cn/), majoring in Math, Economics, and Finance. During the summer of 2023, I had the incredible opportunity to attend a session at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), where I delved into courses on Money and Banking, as well as Introduction to Art and Technique of Filmmaking.

Actually, I took inspiration from an academic template to create what was intended to be an academic and professional website. However, I've decided not to approach this endeavor too formally. Instead, I want to share my personal experiences, motivations, and lifelong goals. This narrative may touch upon moments of my secret sorrows and my battles with self-doubt, but it represents the authentic me. 

If you're interested in delving into my story, let's embark on this journey together.

Passion
======
Firstly, I want to talk about what I'm passionate about. To give you all a quick answer, I would call it "everything that is creative and dialectic." Sent by my mom to a studio when I was 5 years old, I began to engage with fine art. I spent 6 summers studying sketching in that studio. At that time, I didn't know what art and beauty were; all I knew was to "just draw what you think."

When I was 10 years old, I had a specific sketchbook to draw my costume designs. It's sad that I can't find it now, but I remember how I captured my inspiration, sketched it in my book, and racked my brains to select a suitable color for my dresses. During that period, I also started playing the piano. In fact, it's something every parent in China encourages their children to do. However, I am very happy to have experienced those activities and explored something beyond the normal study routine.

Until now, I believe it's those "seemingly useless things" that make me feel truly alive.

As I grew older, my love for the arts expanded to include books, music, and films. In literature, I am particularly drawn to contemporary Chinese works by authors like Shen Congwen, Wang Zengqi, Wang Xiaobo, Yu Hua, and Lao She. Additionally, I find great appreciation in modern Japanese literature, exploring the works of writers such as Kawabata Yasunari and Junichirous Watanabe.

When it comes to music and film, my tastes are diverse, spanning across various genres. I'll share some of my favorites next time.

Motivation
======
Afterward, I want to make it clear that I love communicating with different people. Experiencing new things, adapting to a completely new environment, and meeting new people are amazing to me.

I'm very open to meeting different people. I've chatted with many individualsâ€”some of whom are much older than me, and some I've never met offline because they are overseas. When I go to an opera, I talk with people because I am surprised that we share the same taste in art. When I travel, I engage in conversations because I am curious about the stories behind the people I meet. In class, I interact with others to understand why they have chosen the same classes as me.

Recognizing the importance of discerning when to be silent and understanding the nuances of communication, I navigate social situations with ease. This ability not only simplifies and enriches my life but also ensures I am surrounded by individuals who share a similar outlook and personality.
