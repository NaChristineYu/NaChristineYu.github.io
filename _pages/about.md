I'm currently a third-year undergraduate student at [school of CEMA](http://cema.cufe.edu.cn/index.htm), [CUFE](http://www.cufe.edu.cn/), majoring in Math, Economics, and Finance. I had the incredible opportunity to spend the summer of 2023 at [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/), immersing myself in courses on Money & Banking and the Art & Technique of Filmmaking.

While crafting my self-introduction, I took inspiration from an academic template, intending to create a professional website. However, I've come to realize that I don't want to approach this endeavor with utmost seriousness. Instead, I'm eager to share my personal experiences, motivations, and lifelong goals—elements that might intertwine with my secret sorrows and ongoing struggles with self-doubt. This is the authentic me.

If you're interested in delving into my story, let's embark on this journey together.

Passion
======
First and foremost, I want to share my passion—something I would describe as encompassing "everything that is creative and dialectic". My journey into the realm of fine art began at the age of 5 when my mom sent me to a studio. Over the course of six summers, I immersed myself in the world of sketching, not fully comprehending the concepts of art and beauty but simply enjoying the process of expressing my thoughts on paper.

By the time I turned 10, I had a dedicated sketchbook reserved for my costume designs. Although the book is unfortunately lost to time, the memories remain vivid—the moments of inspiration, the meticulous sketches, and the careful consideration of colors for my imagined dresses. Concurrently, I delved into playing the piano—a pursuit commonly encouraged for children in China. Despite its ubiquity, these experiences brought joy to my life and offered a welcome escape from the routine of conventional studies.

Reflecting on it now, I believe it's these seemingly "useless things" that have given me a sense of vitality and made me feel truly alive.

As I grew older, my love for the arts expanded to include books, music, and films. In literature, I am particularly drawn to contemporary Chinese works by authors like Shen Congwen, Wang Zengqi, Wang Xiaobo, Yu Hua, and Lao She. Additionally, I find great appreciation in modern Japanese literature, exploring the works of writers such as Kawabata Yasunari and Junichirous Watanabe.

When it comes to music and film, my tastes are diverse, spanning across various genres. I'll share some of my favorites next time.

motivation
======
Subsequently, I want to emphasize my genuine enthusiasm for connecting with diverse individuals. The prospect of exploring new experiences, adapting to entirely different environments, and getting to know people from all walks of life holds immense fascination for me.

I approach social interactions with an open mind, having engaged in conversations with a broad spectrum of individuals, ranging from those much older to those residing overseas whom I've never met offline. Whether at the opera, during my travels, or in a classroom setting, I actively seek connections. Engaging with fellow opera-goers, I'm often pleasantly surprised to discover shared artistic tastes. While traveling, my curiosity leads me to strike up conversations, eager to unravel the stories behind the faces I encounter. In academic settings, I find myself talking to classmates, driven by a desire to understand their motivations for taking the same classes.

Recognizing the importance of discerning when to be silent and understanding the nuances of communication, I navigate social situations with ease. This ability not only simplifies and enriches my life but also ensures I am surrounded by individuals who share a similar outlook and personality.
